# YouTube video downloader project
If you want to download the app go to: https://github.com/TakNof/YouTube-video-downloader-project/releases ,go to the version you want to download
(I suggest better donwloading the latest version) and download the zip file located in the *assets* part,
extract it in a folder and open the only .exe file there.

If you have doubts about the project I'll be gladly answering all of them, and I might make a FAQ depending on the questions I get.
Thank you for visiting my profile and my project.
